# funny discord bot
This is my first proper attempt in making a discord bot, it'll just focus on making a database to record some numbers for now.

Currently, it can write to a database and retrieve information about 1 user at a time, and generate a (semi-dynamic) image for a list! One day I'll fix this and make it fully dynamic. 

If you want to use this bot, you can find us [here](https://discord.gg/vzB8DZAkpA).

The entirety of the placemap utility is currently run using the pxlslog-explorer, made by Etos2. You can find it [here](https://github.com/Etos2/pxlslog-explorer). This bot runs using [this version](https://github.com/Etos2/pxlslog-explorer/tree/6deef7cf38498da3a13095b8eb873938a294b202).
