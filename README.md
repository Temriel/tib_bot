# funny discord bot
This is my first proper attempt in making a discord bot, it'll just focus on making a database to record some numbers for now.

Currently, it can write to a database and retrieve information about 1 user at a time, and generate a (semi-dynamic) image for a list! One day I'll fix this and make it fully dynamic. 

If you want to use this bot, you can find us [here](https://discord.gg/vzB8DZAkpA).
